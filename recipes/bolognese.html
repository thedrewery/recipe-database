  <h1>A Bolognese</h1>
  <h3>by Maximillian Einstein</h3>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul class="ingredients">
    <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
    <li>2 spicy italian pork sausages, casings removed</li>
    <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
    <li>2 large carrots, chopped</li>
    <li>3 celery stalks, chopped</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1x -28 oz can whole peeled San Marzano Tomatoes</li>
    <li>12 oz or more of good whole milk</li>
    <li>12 oz or more of dry un-oaked white wine</li>
    <li>pinch of fresh ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>Salt, pepper, olive oil, butter</li>
    <li>~1.5 lb of uncooked pasta</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol class="instructions">
    <li><strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong> Heat a mix of olive oil and butter in an enameled 
      cast iron Dutch Oven (or similar pot). Add chopped onions and sauté 
      until soft and translucent.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Vegetables:</strong> Stir in the chopped carrots and celery. Season lightly 
      with salt as you go, layering flavors. Cook until the vegetables begin 
      to soften.</li>
    <li><strong>Incorporate Meat and Garlic:</strong> Add the ground beef or turkey to the pan 
      along with the minced garlic. Season with salt, pepper, and a drizzle 
      of olive oil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is lightly 
      browned.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Milk:</strong> Pour in enough milk to submerge the mixture. Increase the 
      heat to medium-high and cook until most of the milk has evaporated, 
      stirring occasionally. If desired, add a pinch of nutmeg for warmth.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Deglaze with White Wine:</strong> Pour white wine into the pan, again covering 
      the contents. Cook on medium-high heat, allowing the wine to reduce 
      completely.</li>
    <li><strong>Tomato Time:</strong> Stir in canned whole peeled tomatoes. Break them up as 
      much as possible by up by mashing witha wooden spoon on the side of the pot.
      For additional depth, add fresh diced or sun-dried tomatoes at this stage. 
      If needed, add a splash of water to maintain a saucy consistency. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Simmer Slowly:</strong> Reduce the heat to very low and let the sauce simmer 
      gently for several hours. Stir occasionally, allowing the flavors to 
      meld and the tomatoes to fully incorporate.
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Pair the sauce with your favorite pasta. Fusilli or 
      rigatoni work especially well, but any pasta will do. Top generously 
      with freshly grated Parmesan cheese for a perfect finish.
    </li>
